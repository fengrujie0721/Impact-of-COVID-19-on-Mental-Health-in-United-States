Background:
The COVID‑19 pandemic and it’s associated public health measures have disturbed the lives of people all around the world. It is evident that the indirect and direct social and psychological effects of the pandemic are pernicious and affects the mental health of the human beings.

As a team, we wanted to analyse the mental health, COVID datasets from CDC and answer the following questions:

Has COVID_19 affected the mental health of Americans?
Are areas high COVID-19 deaths more impacted by mental health issues?
Do areas with low COVID-19 rates have lower rates of mental health issues?
How has Georgia been impacted?

Hypothesis: Mental health issues have a positive correlation with COVID-19 death rates by location.
